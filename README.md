# Vanilla Remover

A Minecraft mod that removes all spawn registries for vanilla creatures, preventing their natural spawning.

The concept is simple yet transformative: integrating mods that elevate the core vanilla experience. Take, for instance, one of my other mods, ZombiesAreReal (https://github.com/P-Gruber/ZombiesAreReal). It brings a fresh twist to the traditional Minecraft world, making every encounter a new challenge. Check it out and dive into an enhanced Minecraft experience!
